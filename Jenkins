In the Jenkins we can create multiple jobs in different ways.
1.Freestyle and Maven jobs:in the free style we have to use in terms of plugins to build jobs,like Git plugin,maven plugin,Ansible plugin
 challages: from the scrach we have to configure .its not a Infrastructure as a code.its is fixed ,we cant extend as we needed
 Free styple is a GUI based soo manual intervension will be there.By using script we can do very easyly
2.Multi branch Pipeline: Pipeline as a code. 

how many ways we can create a pipeline?
**********************************
1.using Build-pipeline-plugin
2.using delivery-pipeline-plugin

entire pipeline will be based on upstream job  and downstream job
A--->A1--->A2
Here,A is the upstream job for A1.
      A1 is upstream job for A2
      A! is downsream job for A
      
Master-Slave Architecture:
when we have lot of jobs  executed on the master server,then master server will get busy.its not recomanded.
then for load balance  purpose we will use

jobs will be created on master and workspace will be on the slaves soo that work will be disrtibuted

slave
--------
we dont required jenkins to be installed on slave
jdk,maven and gIt should be install
